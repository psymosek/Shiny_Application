# Shiny_Application

This Shiny application demonstrates that linear regression is a statistical algorithm that
approximates a predicted outcome variable as a function of one or more predictor variables.
This algorithm accomplishes this by minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) of the vertical distance of the predicted outcome variables from a straight line. It can be shown mathematically that the linear approximation passes through the mean of the data.
